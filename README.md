# Python-Secure-Data-Encryption-System
A Streamlit-based Python app for secure data storage. It encrypts data with Fernet and secures passkeys with SHA-256 hashing. After three failed decryption attempts, users must reauthorize through a login page. Easy to set up and extend for learning encryption and secure UI development.
